* There is a problem in query searching:
Let's say the firewall policy says:
RULE ------ SOURCE ------ DESTINATION --- blablabla
1           A               B, C

if the user searches for: dst != B and dst != C
the first part dst != B will return Rule 1 because of dst C
the second part dst != C will return Rule 1 because of dst B
overall, rule 1 will return to the user, which is not whats intended.

It is very hard to fix this problem in code because of how the logic is built. however, i
suggest to resolve that issue in this manner:
for the user to query what he intended, he should do dst != (B,C)

In that way, my code will be able to give that functionality to user with more ease.
